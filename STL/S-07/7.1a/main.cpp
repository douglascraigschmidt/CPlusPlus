/**
 * Container adaptors are classes that are based on other classes to
 * implement a new functionality, often a more limited one. For
 * example, stack and queue restrict sequential containers, such as
 * vector, deque, and list.
 * 
 * Member functions can be added or hidden or can be combined to
 * achieve new functionality.  In particular, container adapters
 * don't support iterators.
 * 
 * Adaptor containers change ordinary containers such as vector,
 * deque, and list into stack and queue, by "adapting" them to reflect
 * a user's expectations (i.e., limiting what their underlying
 * container can do).
